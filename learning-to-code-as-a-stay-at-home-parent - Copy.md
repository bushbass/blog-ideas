Learning to code as a stay at home parent

I'm a stay at home dad who is homeschooling my 8 and 10 year olds, and I've been working on learning to code for a while.  This is not going to be one of those "I learned to code in no time!" articles.  I've been at this for a couple years.  Some days it feels like I know everything and the next I feel like there is so much to learn I feel like giving up.  But I love solving problems and I know that finding a good job and moving my career forward in this field will be rewarding for both me and my family.  When I'm done with school work and driving the kids to swimming, basketball, scouts, D&D club, etc. I get maybe an hour with my wife if I'm lucky then it's off to the part time job at the big orange home store and/or Uber.  How do I squeeze in time to code?!

It's hard!
Let's get this out of the way.  Learning to code is not easy!  Trying to self teach this stuff with limited time is even harder.  There are so many choices!  Even when you figure out what language you're going to learn there are so many resources out there these days it can difficult to know where to start.  Paid courses, Youtube, oh wait this one is out of date. Oops, you just spent 2 hours working through a tutorial to find out it doesn't work becuase a version of something changed.  Who has time for this?  How frustrating!

Imposter syndrome is real
Man it would be great to have the time and money to go to a bootcamp.  It would be really nice to have the guidance, community, and validation that must come with being able to do it.  This is just not in the stars for me.  There is no way I can not be working for even those few weeks.  Not to mention who would be taking care of the kids.  Even on my best coding days I still feel like I can't possibly know as much as people who have gotten there coding education in a more formal setting.  The anxiety makes me feel when I'm working on my resume and applying for jobs is at times debilatating to the point where I frequently don't ever hit the 'apply' button.

What doesn't work
I don't recall which podcast I was listening to, but my gut says it was Shop Talk Show,  where someone made the comment that "you can't learn to code in the cracks" and I've found this to be entirely true.  I've tried getting the kids set up with some work so I can bang through some tutorial or project but that never works.  They have questions and they come first during school time.  I can never get 'in the groove' of coding.  You step away from the keyboard for a minute and you come back to figure out where you left off.
