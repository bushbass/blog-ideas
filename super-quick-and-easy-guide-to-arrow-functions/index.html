    <h1>Super quick guide to arrow functions</h1>
    <p>
      This is NOT a definitive guide to arrow functions. I'm writing a few other
      tutorials and blogs and want to have something to point people to so they
      can have a quick explanation and example of arrow functions since they are
      in so many of the modern frameworks. Just enough to be dangerous! To be
      clear, there are reasons where you should not use arrow functions, but
      they are not going to be discussed in this blog post. I just want you to
      be able to know how they work when you see them "in the wild".
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's get started. I'm going to take you step by step converting a regular
      function into an arrow function.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a regular function using the function keyword</p>

    <p>Let's change that to an anonymous function expression</p>
    <img src="2-sayExpressionName.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      Should be nothing new here so far. No Arrows or ES6 yet, but here it
      comes...
    </p>
    <p>First remove the function keyword and add the arrow</p>

    <p>
      The only thing going on there is removing the function keyword and adding
      the arrow. And that's it! You've gone and made an arrow function! Hurray!
      But wait, there's more!
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is only one argument, you can get rid of the parentheses around
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Getting pretty lean but we can take it even further. If the body of the
      code is only one line, we can get rid of the curly braces.
    </p>

      Frequently, you'll see these used as a callback in another function so
      there is no const and no function name. This is the case that we see quite
      a bit and the real reason I wrote this all up in the first place
    </p>

    <p>
      This doesn't do anything on it's own, but as a callback it's useful
    </p>

      I think that covers the basics. Again this is not mean to be the
      definitive guide, just an intro to figure out what they mean because we
      see them 'in the wild' in all the modern frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a comparison, here's a regular old for loop. Sure, we understand this
      as programmers, but the arrow function just reads like a sentence in
      normal language. So much easier to understand!
